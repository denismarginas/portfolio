        "content": "Denis Marginas Home About Me Personal Workstation Experience Employee Experience Summary Experience Catalog Web Development Visual Media Miscellaneous Contact About Me My name is Denis Ionuț Mărginaș, I'm 25-year-old, and I've been working as a full-stack web developer and photo-video editor since 2019. Before entering the web development field, I worked as a freelance video editor, specializing in editing videos for video games. After completing my university studies in Mathematics and Informatics, I shifted my focus to web development and began pursuing a career in that field. In 2019, I joined Pia Soft Product as a web developer and video-photo editor. During my time there, I worked on various tasks, including creating presentation websites and online shops using platforms like WordPress and Prestashop. I also handled SEO optimization, website and host maintenance, customer communication, and designing banners, logos, and video advertisements. Working independently on my tasks, I took the initiative to learn from scratch, except for my prior experience in video editing. Additionally, I developed web applications using PHP, TPL, SQL, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and more. Towards the end of 2021, I transitioned to working full time at Netex Romania, where I was hired as a front-end developer. My responsibilities involved maintaining multiple WordPress websites and working on web design projects. The web design aspect was particularly challenging as I received templates and page sections in formats, similar to Figma projects, and had to recreate them as static web pages using HTML, SASS, Node.js, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. Initially, I worked independently on my part of the project, but later collaborated with a colleague who joined to assist with the same project. During this time, I gained valuable experience with the GitLab platform, learned Git commands, and improved my teamwork skills.

Also the redesign logo was made by me to. The photo elements was edited in Photopea. At this website I didn't make all the pages, and all the SEO optimization. Here I work with colleague on this websites and on many more. I was hired first time at this small company in 2019 October, we were 2 workers at the beginning only, but the only part where we work together was just on SEO optimization and on the error checking at websites. After approximate 1 year and half from the point I worked there, only me remained as an employee. In total I worked 3 years and 1 month at this company over 30 websites in Wordpress and Prestashop, and over 2000 foto-video media for promotions.
