			"In 2019, I joined Pia Soft Product as a web developer and video-photo editor. During my time there, I worked on various tasks, including creating presentation websites and online shops using platforms like WordPress and Prestashop. I also handled SEO optimization, website and host maintenance, customer communication, and designing banners, logos, and video advertisements. Working independently on my tasks, I took the initiative to learn from scratch, except for my prior experience in video editing. Additionally, I developed web applications using PHP, TPL, SQL, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and more.",
			"Towards the end of 2021, I transitioned to working full time at Netex Romania, where I was hired as a front-end developer. My responsibilities involved maintaining multiple WordPress websites and working on web design projects. The web design aspect was particularly challenging as I received templates and page sections in formats, similar to Figma projects, and had to recreate them as static web pages using HTML, SASS, Node.js, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. Initially, I worked independently on my part of the project, but later collaborated with a colleague who joined to assist with the same project. During this time, I gained valuable experience with the GitLab platform, learned Git commands, and improved my teamwork skills."
