        "content": "Denis Marginas Home Experience Experience as an employee Educational experience path Projects Web Development Visual Media Miscellaneous Contact About Me My name is Denis Ionuț Mărginaș, I'm 26-year-old, and I've been working as a full-stack web developer and photo-video editor since 2019. Before entering the web development field, I worked as a freelance video editor, specializing in editing videos for video games. After completing my university studies in Mathematics and Informatics, I shifted my focus to web development and began pursuing a career in that field. In 2019, I joined Pia Soft Product as a web developer and video-photo editor. During my time there, I worked on various tasks, including creating presentation websites and online shops using platforms like WordPress and Prestashop. I also handled SEO optimization, website and host maintenance, customer communication, and designing banners, logos, and video advertisements. Working independently on my tasks, I took the initiative to learn from scratch, except for my prior experience in video editing. Additionally, I developed web applications using PHP, TPL, SQL, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and more. Towards the end of 2021, I transitioned to working full time at Netex Romania, where I was hired as a front-end developer. My responsibilities involved maintaining multiple WordPress websites and working on web design projects. The web design aspect was particularly challenging as I received templates and page sections in formats, similar to Figma projects, and had to recreate them as static web pages using HTML, SASS, Node.js, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. Initially, I worked independently on my part of the project, but later collaborated with a colleague who joined to assist with the same project. During this time, I gained valuable experience with the GitLab platform, learned Git commands, and improved my teamwork skills.

Explore the intersection of web development and visual storytelling on Denis Ionut Marginas's insightful blog. Denis Marginas 6 December, 2022 My full name is Mărginaș Denis Ionuț, I am 25 years old, and I've been working as a front-end web developer and photo-video editor since 2019. I started the first time to work after I finished the university, Math-Informatics profile, till then, I had some hobbies like video editing with cinematics in video games, and I make even freelancing with this hobby. In 2019 I started to work at Pia Soft Product as a web developer and video-photo editor. There I made presentation websites and online shops on platforms like WordPress and Prestashop, SEO optimization, website, and host maintenance, talks with customers, banners, logos, and video advertisements. At this job I had to work alone on my part, which meant I had to learn everything alone from 0, besides the video editing part. Also, I develop web applications in PHP, TPL, SQL, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and more. From the end of 2021, the first job became part-time, at 4 hours, and I started to work full time this time at Netex Romania. Here I was hired as a front-end developer, and I had to do maintenance on a few websites in WordPress and web design. The web design part was more complex, I got templates of pages in a different format, similar to photo, and page section parts, with few instructions, and I had to recreate them in static web pages using HTML, SASS, Node.js, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery. The project was big, so I started the first time to work alone on my part of it, but also I had meetings with the back-end developers team, and a few months later, a new colleague came to help me on the same part of the project. There I learned for the first time the GitLab platform, git commands, and most importantly teamwork.

The PHP code works in this way: You get the data from form and at the submit button it will create a database if it doesn't exist, will verify the data, all check boxes must be checked, the input fields must be non empty, one radio box must be checked, the code from invoice with the phone number must be unique and used only once in the database (in this example), the data submit must be within the set data range (begin date - end date) and the file upload must be an image in JPG, PNG or GIF format with maximum size of 40 Mb. If the conditions are met, the image file will be compressed and saved in a folder with the name of SQL table name in 'wp-content', the data will be saved in a SQL table from data base with a URL for image, and in the final, the page will reload and instead of the form content will show a specific banner for success status. 1 \/ 4 2 \/ 4 3 \/ 4 4 \/ 4 If the conditions are not met, a specific error message will be displayed below each field, and if the invoice code was previously used in the database, a pop-up message with a specific error message will be displayed or a banner will be displayed. If the campaign has started, the submit button from the form will not appear or a banner will appear instead of the form, if the campaign is over, a banner will appear instead of the form. A button to download CSV data from data base will show if you are an admin or editor of WordPress, or if you have the credentials from code inserted in URL. The form is implemented with PHP Everywhere widget and Elementor page builder. 1 \/ 3 2 \/ 3 3 \/ 3 Web Development Projects UPLOAD PAID ARTICLES - WORDPRESS This project have a custom PHP code integrated with 2 modules that which allows you uploading files depending on the number of uploads or depending on the subscription. The number of uploads and subscriptions can be purchased with payment by card. The files accepted by the administrator will be displayed on the site and stored in a SQL database. Modules used: Elementor, PHP Everywhere, WooCommerce, WooCommerce Points and Rewards, WooCommerce Memberships Web Development Projects AUTOCOMPLET FORM - PRESTASHOP This is the Contact Form 7 module, but modified (with PHP, TPL and JavaScript), so that it takes over the user's data: name, email, phone and automatically fills them in the form. On the product page is displayed a button to request an offer, and it displays the form form but autocompletes the message field with a text containing the name of the desired product 'I want to receive an offer for this product: product-name'. Modules used: Elementor, Contact Form 7, Boom Custom CSS and Javascript Web Development Projects WEB DESIGN - STATIC WEB PAGES For this project, I hosted a local server with Node.js and I recreated the design from image templates provided, in static web pages using HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. Web Development Projects SEO OPTIMIZATION - PRESTASHOP & WORDPRESS For some websites, I had to do SEO Optimization, with tools like Google Chrome Lighthouse for fixing errors, adding meta titles, meta descriptions, and keywords for pages, fixing hreflang links, fixing alt images, fixing multiple h1 tags, performance increase where is possible, CSS and JS code inline, adding robots.txt, generate pages map, and indexing on Google Search Console. Projects: www.agromir.ro , www.agramix.ro , www.revelnail.ro . Web Development Projects EXPORT PRODUCTS FEED - PRESTASHOP With this PHP script you can export all products with name, url, images, price, stock, description, summary, ean13. It is not optimized for products with combinations. Can be use as a feed with a cron job. Web Development Projects IMPORT PRODUCTS FROM FEED - PRESTASHOP Add products to the Prestashop 1.7 website from a CSV feed, create products, set stock, create categories, brand, disable if the scripts can't find the products in CSV anymore. This import is made with 2 PHP scripts that are used as cron jobs in cPanel, but can be use with a cron module to. These 2 scripts make stock synchronization possible of 2 stores, in other words it takes the data from feed, feed provided from the globiz.ro store and is used at the lavmag.ro store.
