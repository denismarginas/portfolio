After completing my university studies in Mathematics and Informatics, I shifted my focus to web development and began pursuing a career in that field. In 2019, I joined Pia Soft Product as a web developer and video-photo editor. During my time there, I worked on various tasks, including creating presentation websites and online shops using platforms like WordPress and Prestashop. I also handled SEO optimization, website and host maintenance, customer communication, and designing banners, logos, and video advertisements. Working independently on my tasks, I took the initiative to learn from scratch, except for my prior experience in video editing. Additionally, I developed web applications using PHP, TPL, SQL, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and more. Towards the end of 2021, I transitioned to working full time at Netex Romania, where I was hired as a front-end developer. My responsibilities involved maintaining multiple WordPress websites and working on web design projects. The web design aspect was particularly challenging as I received templates and page sections in formats, similar to Figma projects, and had to recreate them as static web pages using HTML, SASS, Node.js, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. Initially, I worked independently on my part of the project, but later collaborated with a colleague who joined to assist with the same project. During this time, I gained valuable experience with the GitLab platform, learned Git commands, and improved my teamwork skills.

For more details, please read our Privacy Policy . Accept Cookies Web Development Seo Optimization 1 \/ 2 2 \/ 2 The website was optimized for high performance, ensuring a seamless balance between numerous custom implementations and the use of various plugins. Live Pricing Updates Product prices for gold, silver, and platinum are automatically updated every 2 minutes, ensuring accurate and up-to-date values powered by a reliable metal price API. This functionality was custom-built using advanced code and ACF fields tailored for each WooCommerce product. Key fields include metal type, currency, weight unit (oz\/gram), weight, and markup—enabling precise calculations for dynamic pricing. To automate the updates seamlessly, I implemented a custom scheduler event cron that triggers the price update every 2 minutes. The process is closely monitored using the WP Crontrol plugin, which ensures the cron jobs are executed as expected. Additionally, I incorporated price validation security conditions to guarantee reliability. These conditions prevent prices from being set to 0 or null and ensure that only valid numeric float values are accepted, maintaining accuracy and stability for live pricing. Custom Checkout Once you reach checkout, prices are locked for 5 minutes to ensure stability, even with frequent updates. This feature was implemented because product prices are updated every 2 minutes, which could otherwise disrupt the checkout experience. To address this, we created a custom solution that saves the current checkout price in cache for 5 minutes. During this time, the total remains fixed, providing you with a consistent and stable price. After the 5-minute window expires, the checkout total will automatically refresh to reflect the latest live prices, and a new 5-minute price lock will begin. This ensures a smooth and predictable checkout process while maintaining the accuracy of dynamically updated prices. Bullion House A feature-rich online shop specializing in buying and selling metal coins and bars, designed to handle the complexities of real-time pricing and user-friendly functionality. Key Features: Live Pricing Updates: Product prices for gold, silver, and platinum automatically update every 2 minutes, powered by a reliable metal price API. Interactive Live Metal Prices: The website displays live metal prices and a dynamic price graph, seamlessly integrated into the header and a professional-grade popup using additional API data. Instant Buy & Discounts: Users can sell similar products directly to the website, with quantity-based discounts automatically applied to purchases. Custom Checkout Options: A custom subscription and shipping plugin enables users to make deposits during checkout. Once in checkout, prices are locked for 5 minutes to ensure stability despite frequent updates. Enhanced Functionality with Plugins: Leveraging various plugins, the site offers advanced features such as instant buy options, subscription models, and custom shipping solutions. This innovative platform not only provides a seamless buying and selling experience but also ensures precision and reliability in a dynamic market.

For more details, please read our Privacy Policy . Accept Cookies Web Development Deposit Plugin Dynamic Price Update Handler A JavaScript observer was implemented on the website to monitor changes to the total price of WooCommerce products. This was necessary because the deposit amount depends on the selected product variation. The observer dynamically updates the deposit option when selected, displaying a notification message that shows the price difference between the full amount and the deposit amount. This ensures users always see accurate deposit pricing based on their chosen variation. The logic was added due to the behavior of the deposit plugin used on the product page, which allows customers to choose between paying in full or paying a deposit. WooCommerce Custom Options to Variation Sync This script enables custom product option blocks (e.g., for cruise duration, boat capacity, boat type, or grouped fields) to stay in sync with standard WooCommerce variation selects. It detects user interactions with styled option blocks, updates the underlying select element accordingly, and triggers the necessary change events so WooCommerce can update variation prices, availability, and deposit behaviors properly. This improves compatibility between visual product selectors and WooCommerce’s native variation system. Number Input Customizer This script enhances the number input fields created by the Product Addons plugin in WooCommerce by transforming them into a user-friendly component with a central value display flanked by customizable minus and plus buttons. It respects minimum, maximum, and step attributes, and dynamically updates both the hidden input and visible number. It provides a clean UI and better user interaction for numeric fields like quantities, hours, or people. ACF Repeater Show More\/Less Displays a limited number of cruise feature items (from an ACF Repeater field added to the product\/post) by default, with a +X more and Show less toggle to expand or collapse the full list. Dynamic Add to Cart Text for Date Picker Automatically updates the WooCommerce Add to Cart button text based on the selected date from a Product Add-Ons date field. If no date is selected, it shows Select a Date; otherwise, it changes to Book Now. This enhances booking flow for products like cruises or appointments. Auto Limit Guest Input by Selected Boat Type Automatically adjusts the Number of Guests input field based on the selected boat type or capacity variation in a cruise product. When a user selects a boat type (variation), the script reads the number (e.g., capacity) and sets it as the maximum allowed in the number input field. It also updates the UI to reflect the max limit and prevents values above it. Useful when variations are displayed as custom visual selectors instead of standard dropdowns. Passenger Filter Buttons for Elementor Loop Adds custom filter buttons that dynamically show or hide Elementor loop items (boats) based on their passenger capacity. Each button targets loop items by reading the number of passengers inside a .filter-passengers span element and filters accordingly. Useful for categorizing boat listings into ranges like ≤7 passengers or 8–11 passengers with visual button toggles instead of traditional form elements. Corfu Private Cruises A cruise booking application built on the WordPress platform, where users can select tours by boat. The tours are created as WooCommerce products with variations such as capacity, duration, and boat type. Using the WooCommerce Product Add-Ons Ultimate plugin, additional custom fields were implemented for enhanced personalization, including the number of guests, departure location, restaurant stop, and departure time. This website was developed as a replica of another existing site, requiring the design and functionality to match 100% accurately. The cruise\/tour products involve complex field relationships, which were achieved through a combination of plugins, custom PHP, and vanilla JavaScript, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience on the frontend. The site includes custom JavaScript enhancements that update deposit details when variations change, sync visual selectors with WooCommerce options, improve number input usability, toggle cruise feature lists, change the booking button text based on selected dates, adjust guest limits by boat capacity, and filter boat options by passenger count.

For more details, please read our Privacy Policy . Accept Cookies Web Development Manage Kids In Groups This task involved creating a private admin page for website administrators to efficiently manage children registered through camp orders, ultimately helping camp teachers better organize their groups. Each order includes camp products, which contain child-specific data and selected registration weeks (1 to 4 weeks). I developed a custom environment that dynamically generates a table by extracting child data and custom fields (such as the selected weeks) from orders, displaying each child as a row. Administrators can then assign children to groups, which are stored in a separate custom post type with all relevant data saved. Additionally, I implemented advanced filters for the table, allowing sorting and searching by child name, group, registration weeks, order date, and other custom fields. Date: 02.2025 Export Advance CSV from HTML Table I developed a vanilla JavaScript script that automatically generates a bottom section after each HTML table from Family First. This section includes two buttons and one input field. The input allows users to customize the CSV delimiter, while the buttons handle table data export. The first button performs a basic export—excluding toggle content and HTML formatting. The second button triggers an advanced export that scans toggle sections for custom fields with labels and values, then adds new columns to the CSV using those labels, filling in each row with the corresponding values. Date: 02.2025 Family First An online shop where customers can purchase subscriptions to various types of kids' camps (like summer camps and English camps). To make this possible, users must create an account and add their children to their account to access the products. Once the user has added at least one child, they can access product pages for the camps to register their children. They will need to select a child from their list of children. This selection process was made possible with custom PHP and jQuery code, along with the WooCommerce Product Add-Ons Ultimate plugin. Additionally, complex voucher conditions were created using plugins, which apply automatically but only under certain conditions related to the number of camp subscription weeks and the user's list of children. Project wich involves designing and developing a website.

For more details, please read our Privacy Policy . Accept Cookies Web Development National Rugs Cleaners – Quote-to-Checkout System I implemented a Clean Rug system on the WordPress website. It works as follows: the user fills out a Quote Form made with Elementor, and after submitting, they are redirected to the first Rug Product page (Rug 1) with the form parameters passed along. From there, users can add up to 10 different rugs, each with their own parameters such as zip code, feet, length, width, and others. This functionality is handled using the WooCommerce Product Add-Ons Ultimate plugin. To make this system work, I created multiple custom code snippets. These snippets populate the input fields on the product page with the values from the Quote Form. They also populate the checkout form fields, pulling information like the zip code from the first product and address or name from the original Quote Form. I added extra buttons to the Single Product Template: one button to add another rug (allowing up to 10 rugs in total) and another button to proceed directly to checkout. I also changed the text displayed in the Cart and Checkout pages, customizing the wording from the WooCommerce Deposits and Part Payments plugin. The new text explains more clearly that 50% of the total order is paid upfront and the remaining 50% is paid in person. This entire custom system is designed to work only if the products in the cart belong to the specific taxonomy created for the Cleaning Quote.

For more details, please read our Privacy Policy . Accept Cookies Web Development Apply Reseller Coupons via URL This project involved implementing custom code to improve WooCommerce functionality for resellers. A custom post type named Resellers was created and linked to user accounts via a Reseller ID, allowing a coupon table to appear in the My Account section on the frontend. Each Reseller Post includes custom fields such as image, location, name, and a repeater field for storing assigned coupons. The repeater contains the Coupon ID, now visible when editing coupons, and the Coupon URL parameter used in the shareable link structure. When a Reseller Post is updated, the repeater field updates automatically and builds the full shareable link in the format: [Product URL]\/?r={Reseller ID}&c={Coupon Param URL}. When a product URL includes valid reseller and coupon parameters, a box near the product title displays reseller details, including their image, name, and location, along with the full discount percentage. The discount adjusts dynamically based on the sale price if the product is on sale or as a percentage of the fixed discount amount when applicable. A PHP REST API retrieves reseller and coupon data, and custom logic applies the coupon when the page loads. Since WooCommerce does not adjust product prices dynamically when a coupon is applied, custom code updates the frontend product price with the correct discounted amount. The side cart also features modifications where the coupon discount appears, and the total cart value updates accordingly using custom Offmarket A reseller shop based on a classic WordPress WooCommerce setup, where certain users are designated as resellers and have access to coupons that can be shared with potential customers via product URLs. In the reseller’s frontend account (under \"My Account\"), a table will display the coupons assigned to them by the site administrator. This table will also include the shareable link structure, showing the parameters to add to a product URL: [Product URL]\/?r={Reseller ID}&c={Coupon Code} Since WooCommerce does not update the product price when a coupon is applied, custom code has been implemented to dynamically adjust the price on the frontend, including in the mini cart popup, where the coupon discount is displayed. Additionally, the cart total has been modified to reflect the applied discount, as this functionality was not included in WooCommerce's default Elementor widgets. The purpose of resellers is to share products on social marketplaces like Facebook Marketplace, including their reseller ID and coupon, to drive more sales and earn rewards.

Explore the intersection of web development and visual storytelling on Denis Ionut Marginas's insightful blog. Denis Marginas 6 December, 2022 My full name is Mărginaș Denis Ionuț, I am 25 years old, and I've been working as a front-end web developer and photo-video editor since 2019. I started the first time to work after I finished the university, Math-Informatics profile, till then, I had some hobbies like video editing with cinematics in video games, and I make even freelancing with this hobby. In 2019 I started to work at Pia Soft Product as a web developer and video-photo editor. There I made presentation websites and online shops on platforms like WordPress and Prestashop, SEO optimization, website, and host maintenance, talks with customers, banners, logos, and video advertisements. At this job I had to work alone on my part, which meant I had to learn everything alone from 0, besides the video editing part. Also, I develop web applications in PHP, TPL, SQL, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and more. From the end of 2021, the first job became part-time, at 4 hours, and I started to work full time this time at Netex Romania. Here I was hired as a front-end developer, and I had to do maintenance on a few websites in WordPress and web design. The web design part was more complex, I got templates of pages in a different format, similar to photo, and page section parts, with few instructions, and I had to recreate them in static web pages using HTML, SASS, Node.js, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery. The project was big, so I started the first time to work alone on my part of it, but also I had meetings with the back-end developers team, and a few months later, a new colleague came to help me on the same part of the project.

For more details, please read our Privacy Policy . Accept Cookies Summary Work Experience 2019 - 2022 Web Development Projects PHP\/SQL\/HTML\/JS\/CSS FORM - WORDPRESS Single Form Page made with PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL. The PHP code works in this way: You get the data from form and at the submit button it will create a database if it doesn't exist, will verify the data, all check boxes must be checked, the input fields must be non empty, one radio box must be checked, the code from invoice with the phone number must be unique and used only once in the database (in this example), the data submit must be within the set data range (begin date - end date) and the file upload must be an image in JPG, PNG or GIF format with maximum size of 40 Mb. If the conditions are met, the image file will be compressed and saved in a folder with the name of SQL table name in 'wp-content', the data will be saved in a SQL table from data base with a URL for image, and in the final, the page will reload and instead of the form content will show a specific banner for success status. If the conditions are not met, a specific error message will be displayed below each field, and if the invoice code was previously used in the database, a pop-up message with a specific error message will be displayed or a banner will be displayed. If the campaign has started, the submit button from the form will not appear or a banner will appear instead of the form, if the campaign is over, a banner will appear instead of the form. A button to download CSV data from data base will show if you are an admin or editor of WordPress, or if you have the credentials from code inserted in URL. The form is implemented with PHP Everywhere widget and Elementor page builder. 1 \/ 4 2 \/ 4 3 \/ 4 4 \/ 4 Web Development Projects UPLOAD PAID ARTICLES - WORDPRESS This project have a custom PHP code integrated with 2 modules that which allows you uploading files depending on the number of uploads or depending on the subscription. The number of uploads and subscriptions can be purchased with payment by card. The files accepted by the administrator will be displayed on the site and stored in a SQL database. Modules used: Elementor, PHP Everywhere, WooCommerce, WooCommerce Points and Rewards, WooCommerce Memberships Web Development Projects AUTOCOMPLET FORM - PRESTASHOP This is the Contact Form 7 module, but modified (with PHP, TPL and JavaScript), so that it takes over the user's data: name, email, phone and automatically fills them in the form. On the product page is displayed a button to request an offer, and it displays the form form but autocompletes the message field with a text containing the name of the desired product 'I want to receive an offer for this product: product-name'. Modules used: Elementor, Contact Form 7, Boom Custom CSS and Javascript Web Development Projects WEB DESIGN - STATIC WEB PAGES For this project, I hosted a local server with Node.js and I recreated the design from image templates provided, in static web pages using HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. Web Development Projects SEO OPTIMIZATION - PRESTASHOP & WORDPRESS For some websites, I had to do SEO Optimization, with tools like Google Chrome Lighthouse for fixing errors, adding meta titles, meta descriptions, and keywords for pages, fixing hreflang links, fixing alt images, fixing multiple h1 tags, performance increase where is possible, CSS and JS code inline, adding robots.txt, generate pages map, and indexing on Google Search Console. Projects: www.agromir.ro , www.agramix.ro , www.revelnail.ro . 1 \/ 2 2 \/ 2 Web Development Projects EXPORT PRODUCTS FEED - PRESTASHOP With this PHP script you can export all products with name, url, images, price, stock, description, summary, ean13. It is not optimized for products with combinations. Can be use as a feed with a cron job. Web Development Projects IMPORT PRODUCTS FROM FEED - PRESTASHOP Add products to the Prestashop 1.7 website from a CSV feed, create products, set stock, create categories, brand, disable if the scripts can't find the products in CSV anymore. This import is made with 2 PHP scripts that are used as cron jobs in cPanel, but can be use with a cron module to. These 2 scripts make stock synchronization possible of 2 stores, in other words it takes the data from feed, feed provided from the globiz.ro store and is used at the lavmag.ro store.
